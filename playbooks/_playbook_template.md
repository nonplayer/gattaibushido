# What Do Your Friends Think of You?

Now let's take your concept a step further, and start writing down some numbers! Use the following descriptive adjective choices to build your Pilot's initial **Commitments** spread. **First pick three** on your own and fill in the dots indicated, three for each adjective. **Second** have the players to your left and right each pick one as well. **Third** have Coach select a sixth and final one. **Finally**, once six have been selected, total their stat mods and note them on your final record sheet, under Commitments.

Feel free to go off-list and come up with new ones! Or look at the other playbooks for alternatives. When done, you should have 6 total points spread within the stats of each of your six Commitments.



# (Chroma Name's) Power Profile

As the (Role Name), your specialty is (Role Details Short form). Pick one of your two core powers as your Pilot's starting specialty. These can evolve over time, and you can eventually unlock all three if you want! Pick one right now, and fill in the "Level 1" dot next to it.

* **"Power Name!"** - (Primary Tech) Description
* **"Power Name!"** - (Secondary Tech) Description

(Text Note for Players: You don't actually *have* to pick right now if you aren't sure. It can be even more fun to decide later on once the game begins, letting your power emerge in the story as something new and unknown! Be sure and tell Coach if you want to do this.)


## Team Mods

Your choice of Chroma also indirectly affects the Team by adjusting background stats and resources.


### Starting Team Adjustments

During Team Creation, adjust the following team resources automatically:

* **Harmony:** +X
* **Armory:** +X
* **Fan Club:** +X
* **Pit Crew:** +X


### Recurring Team Adjustments

At the start of every brand new Scenario, make the following additional Resource adjustments:

* **Harmony:** +X
* **Armory:** +X
* **Fan Club:** +X
* **Pit Crew:** +X


## Chroma Lesson and Schism Triggers

**Next**, note your Chroma's special Lesson and Schism triggers. The first is a special prompt that allows you to gain Lessons during play by role-playing your role's strengths and weaknesses in purely narrative ways. The latter gives you role-playing leads for causing Team strife.

* **Lesson Trigger:** DESCRIPTION


## Chroma Gambit Specialty

When you incorporate your Chroma's specialty directly into a Gambit, you add more narrative effect to the outcome!

* **Gambit Specialties:** DESCRIPTION.



# Your Daisho: What Weapon Do You Wield?

Now it's time to build your Daisho! This is the unique weapon that you specialize in when fighting The Enemy face to face. First, pick the frame -  go with what speaks to your style, or instead choose based on the power you like the most.

* base choice 1: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)
* base choice 2: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)
* base choice 3: TECH DESCRIPTION (does not require a charge)


#### Now Give It Some Power!

Once you've chosen your base Frame, pick from one of the following extra powers and add it to the Daisho:

* Mod choice 1: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)
* Mod choice 2: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)
* Mod choice 3: TECH DESCRIPTION (requires a charge)



# Your Giant Robo

This special vehicle gives you extra powers in fights, and also allows you to assemble your Team's Final Form. If you aren't feeling the one below, swap it with a different playbook, or choose from the book instead.


#### (Adjective), But/And (Other Adjective): The (Robot Name)

(Short Description, maybe two or three sentences max)

Note the following core components:

* **Robo Grit:** This starts at 6, but can be increased later.
* **Summon Effect:** (triggers when you first summon the Robo in a session) DESCRIPTION
* **Robo Primary:**
* **Robo Secondary:**

# Concept Expansion

Now that you have figured out all the math stuff, let's get back to finishing up your Concept with some *much* deeper questions!


#### Team Sacrifices

**Tell us about one time you pissed off or even outright humiliated the Pilot to your left.** What did you do? Why was she forced to let it go? That Pilot's player must record this as her first Sacrifice.

* **YOURS:** (Given to you by the player to *your* right)


**Tell us about a really gnarly fight that the Pilot to your right got into, in defense of the Team or someone on it.** Who were they fighting, and why? Who started it? Who won? That Pilot's player must record this as her second Sacrifice.

* **YOURS:** (Given to you by the player to *your* left)


**Tell us about a relationship that you lost due to your joining this Team.** Who or what was lost to you? How did this loss happen? How do you feel about it? Record this below as your own third Sacrifice:

* **YOURS:** (write it here)


#### Final Story Questions

As a final step toward fleshing out your new Pilot's personality, turn to the list on p. XX of the game rules and either pick or draw three of the bonus questions. Write them below, and answer them for your Pilot. These are purely for story!"

1. __________
2. __________
3. __________



# For Later: Evolution!

As you learn Lessons through play, you will acquire Evolutions which you can spend to increase your Pilot's current powers, or even add new ones. The rules are explained more in the game book, but for now, follow this basic flow when you start getting them:

1. **Your First Evolution:** Evolve one of your Tech Paths
2. **Your Second Evolution:** Evolve a different Tech Path
3. **Your Third Evolution:** Evolve your Commitments

**Evolve Tech Paths:** When you evolve this, pick one of the following:

* **Chroma:** Either add a Level to one of your Role Techs, or acquire a new Role Tech from your list.
* **Daisho:** Add a new Mod Tech of your choice to your Daisho.
* **Personal Robo:** Increase your Robo Rank by 1.

**Evolve Commitments:** When you evolve this, give yourself a new descriptive adjective, and an associated +1 increase to any single Commitment of your choice.



# Finishing Touches

You're almost done! Note your **Class Rank** as "Freshman," and then jot down the following final array of derived stats for your Pilot:

* **Buffers:** Base equals your Synapse stat.
* **Max Hand:** Begins at 3 cards.
* **Charge Pool:** Your Maximum Charge Pool is equal to *twice* your Circuit stat. It begins play half-filled (round up, if applicable).



# What's Your Name?

Can't forget this part! If you're having trouble coming up with a name, randomly pick from the sample suggestions below:

Adriana, Bandile, Cordelia, Delores, Eulalia, Fabiana, Gwyneira, Hanako, Isobella, Jingyi, Kiyoko, Leimoni, Mpho, Natalie, Opeyemi, Pien, Qiana, Ragnbjǫrg, Sakiko, Tuyến, Ulla, Vivien, Willa, Xuan, Yayame, Zuzana



# Playbook Wrap-Up

If you haven't already, now go back through the sheet and take note of all of your choices, copying them to the attached Pilot Record Sheet. From now on that will be your main game details reference, but keep this playbook worksheet around to in can you need to go back and revive your inspiration!

**Advanced:** Not enough options for you? Want to tweak the choices, or roll with something else? Got your eye on a different Robo entirely? Coach has all the details and is here to help you, just ask him!

**Welcome to Battle School, Freshman!**
